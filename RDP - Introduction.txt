Lee Kirkpatrick: Hi, my name is Lee
Kirkpatrick, and I'm an incident lead

0:00:03.399,0:00:05.219
with the Sophos Rapid Response team.

0:00:05.519,0:00:08.659
And today I'm going to be
introducing a series surrounding

0:00:08.659,0:00:10.159
the Remote Desktop Protocol.

0:00:10.749,0:00:15.979
So the Remote Desktop Protocol, or RDP for
short, was developed by Microsoft as a way

0:00:16.149,0:00:20.579
to allow users, administrators, whoever
else, to connect to remote computers

0:00:20.634,0:00:25.404
over a network connection and provide
them with a graphical user interface.

0:00:25.844,0:00:29.894
Now, the tools required for this come
as standard on Microsoft Windows.

0:00:29.964,0:00:33.714
So to initiate and set up an RDP
connection, all of the tools that are

0:00:33.714,0:00:35.624
required to do that are there by default.

0:00:35.974,0:00:38.764
And because of these reasons,
it's something that's used quite

0:00:38.764,0:00:42.524
extensively throughout networks
by users and administrators in

0:00:42.524,0:00:44.644
order to access remote machines.

0:00:45.664,0:00:50.394
Now, unfortunately, due to the
widespread use of RDP, it's

0:00:50.394,0:00:54.084
something that's also quite commonly
abused by ransomware groups.

0:00:54.524,0:00:56.304
And there's a number of reasons for this.

0:00:56.464,0:01:00.524
It's because it blends in with typical
user and administrative behavior.

0:01:00.954,0:01:03.644
They're not having to bring in
those additional tools that may

0:01:03.644,0:01:06.044
be detected by antivirus or EDR.

0:01:06.484,0:01:10.144
It provides them with that graphical user
interface that may make it easier for

0:01:10.144,0:01:15.484
them to browse files for exfiltration,
to install and use various applications.

0:01:16.002,0:01:19.632
Attackers also know that RDP is
quite commonly misconfigured or

0:01:19.642,0:01:21.662
misused throughout an environment.

0:01:22.352,0:01:26.902
There's a graph here from Shodan that
shows the exposure of the remote desktop

0:01:26.912,0:01:28.642
protocol to the internet, for example.

0:01:29.372,0:01:32.592
And as you can see throughout the
years, there's been quite a large

0:01:32.622,0:01:37.052
number of devices that do have RDP
exposed to the internet, anywhere

0:01:37.052,0:01:38.822
from three to four million, roughly.

0:01:39.477,0:01:42.947
Now, granted, some of those are going
to be honeypots, some of those are

0:01:42.947,0:01:46.207
going to be test machines, and some
of those are probably even going to be

0:01:46.207,0:01:49.847
attacker machines, but there's still a
large number of devices that have RDP

0:01:49.847,0:01:53.797
exposed, and there's still a lot of
organizations that expose RDP as a means

0:01:53.797,0:01:55.377
of remote access when they shouldn't.

0:01:56.107,0:01:59.447
Now, unfortunately, quite commonly, when
we're brought in to deal with an incident

0:01:59.447,0:02:04.687
and we find the root cause was because
of exposed RDP, the accounts within

0:02:04.687,0:02:09.997
the organization have weak credentials
associated with them, and quite commonly

0:02:09.997,0:02:13.787
what we see is attackers managed to
actually obtain access by brute-forcing

0:02:13.807,0:02:18.877
the administrator account because it has
a weak password, such as "password1!"

0:02:18.897,0:02:19.717
for example.

0:02:20.537,0:02:25.892
We also see that there's a lot of
misuse of RDP within organizations.

0:02:25.922,0:02:30.232
We see administrators incorrectly using
highly privileged accounts for RDP, such

0:02:30.232,0:02:34.152
as service accounts or domain admins when
they should be using the principle of

0:02:34.152,0:02:38.772
least privilege and only accessing devices
with RDP with low-privileged accounts

0:02:38.772,0:02:41.067
to perform that task and that task only.

0:02:41.597,0:02:46.367
We also see administrators disabling
security features of RDP, such

0:02:46.367,0:02:49.647
as network level authentication,
which we'll discuss a lot more

0:02:49.647,0:02:51.247
in depth throughout this series.

0:02:51.817,0:02:54.427
We also see lack of
things like segregation.

0:02:54.897,0:03:00.087
So why was James from HR able to RDP
to a domain controller, for example?

0:03:01.042,0:03:05.132
Now, please join us throughout the series
where we'll discuss some tips and tricks

0:03:05.132,0:03:09.532
on how you can use Sophos to better secure
your environment and potentially identify

0:03:09.732,0:03:12.112
suspicious or malicious RDP abuse.

0:03:12.362,0:03:12.862
Thank you.
