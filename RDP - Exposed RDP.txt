Lee Fitzgerald: Hi, my name is Lee
Kirkpatrick, and I'm an incident lead

0:00:03.554,0:00:07.414
with the Sophos Rapid Response Team,
and today I'm going to be discussing the

0:00:07.424,0:00:10.544
dangers of exposing RDP to the internet.

0:00:11.544,0:00:15.414
Now, you may be wondering -- is it
really that bad for me to expose

0:00:15.414,0:00:17.154
a server with RDP to the internet?

0:00:17.594,0:00:20.284
Well, in order to find
out, we did just that.

0:00:20.394,0:00:25.674
We stood up a server, exposed RDP to the
internet, and we left it for 15 days.

0:00:26.294,0:00:30.024
When we came back, we found out
that login attempts started in under

0:00:30.034,0:00:33.694
one minute from us exposing that
server to the internet with RDP.

0:00:34.394,0:00:38.194
So even if you're thinking about
temporarily exposing a server to the

0:00:38.194,0:00:42.554
internet with RDP for someone to remote
access, those brute force attempts

0:00:42.604,0:00:44.424
are going to roll in pretty quickly.

0:00:45.094,0:00:49.814
We also pulled out some statistics
regarding the most commonly used usernames

0:00:49.864,0:00:54.104
in order to try and obtain access,
and unsurprisingly, "administrator" and

0:00:54.104,0:00:57.174
variants of took the top three spots.

0:00:57.794,0:01:04.784
Administrator actually had 866,
862 failed login attempts alone.

0:01:05.419,0:01:10.069
Now, that's not too surprising, because
most of the cases we've worked here at

0:01:10.069,0:01:14.749
Sophos where RDP exposed to the internet
was the initial access vector, the

0:01:14.749,0:01:18.929
attacker managed to obtain access by
brute-forcing the administrator account.

0:01:19.639,0:01:23.529
And that's because most often what
we see is the organizations that

0:01:23.529,0:01:28.269
expose RDP to the internet quite
often have poor password policies.

0:01:28.279,0:01:32.049
So it makes it quite easy for the
ransomware groups to brute force

0:01:32.049,0:01:34.219
their way into those accounts.

0:01:34.824,0:01:41.124
Now, in total, we saw that 137,500 unique
usernames were actually being attempted.

0:01:41.124,0:01:45.734
So quite a diverse range of usernames
and the scanning activity was taking

0:01:45.734,0:01:49.434
place from 999 unique IP addresses.

0:01:50.094,0:01:56.524
And in total, we saw just over 2 million
failed login attempts in 15 days.

0:01:56.914,0:01:59.574
So there's still a lot of
people scanning for open RDP.

0:01:59.614,0:02:03.164
It's still a common initial access
vector, and it's definitely dangerous

0:02:03.164,0:02:05.054
to expose RDP to the internet.

0:02:07.024,0:02:10.284
Now, you may be wondering, But
what if I expose RDP on a different

0:02:10.284,0:02:12.804
port to the default, which is 3389?

0:02:13.294,0:02:15.864
Unfortunately, that does not matter.

0:02:15.984,0:02:20.924
Scanners and ransomware groups are still
going to identify that RDP is listening,

0:02:20.924,0:02:23.354
no matter how obscure that port is.

0:02:23.834,0:02:28.264
And in order to showcase that, what we've
done is a really simple search on Censys,

0:02:28.904,0:02:32.194
the RDP not being on the
default port of 3389.

0:02:32.474,0:02:36.194
And as you can see highlighted here,
no matter how obscure you make that

0:02:36.194,0:02:40.374
port, it's still incredibly easy
for these scanners and subsequently

0:02:40.374,0:02:44.674
ransomware groups to identify if
RDP is open on one of your servers.

0:02:45.394,0:02:49.784
And as we discussed previously, it's
not safe to do even temporarily.

0:02:50.294,0:02:54.814
We had brute force attempts occurring in
less than one minute from RDP being open.

0:02:55.274,0:02:58.844
There are much secure methods to allow
remote access to your environment,

0:02:59.134,0:03:01.754
such as a VPN with MFA, for example.

0:03:03.214,0:03:07.054
Now I hope that showcases the dangers
of exposing RDP to the internet.

0:03:07.344,0:03:09.754
Thank you very much for your time
and I'll catch you on the next video.
