Lee Kirkpatrick: Hi, my name is Lee
Kirkpatrick, and I'm an incident lead

0:00:03.239,0:00:04.840
with the Sophos Rapid Response team.

0:00:05.130,0:00:08.469
And in today's video, I'm going to be
running you through a query that we've

0:00:08.490,0:00:11.949
previously discussed in one of our
presentations as part of this series.

0:00:12.390,0:00:16.233
Specifically, the query that we're
going to focus on today is  RDP

0:00:16.233,0:00:18.393
Logins from External IPs.sql.

0:00:19.128,0:00:22.788
Now, this query, as we previously
discussed, is fairly self-explanatory

0:00:22.808,0:00:26.098
based on the name, but it's going
to be looking for successful

0:00:26.098,0:00:29.778
RDP connections that have taken
place from external IP addresses.

0:00:29.788,0:00:33.158
So that would be anything
that's non-RFC 1918.

0:00:34.058,0:00:37.258
So what we can do is we can take
that query, we can log into our

0:00:37.258,0:00:41.458
Sophos Central instance, which
I've done here, navigate to Threat

0:00:41.458,0:00:43.518
Analysis Center and Live Discover.

0:00:44.443,0:00:47.123
Now, what we can do here is
select the Designer Mode.

0:00:47.303,0:00:50.653
This is actually going to
allow us to create a new query.

0:00:50.933,0:00:53.423
And upon selecting this option,
what you'll see on the right

0:00:53.703,0:00:55.493
is the Create new query button.

0:00:55.853,0:00:58.863
So that's what we want to select
after the Designer Mode option.

0:00:59.763,0:01:03.843
Now, this is going to drop us into a view
where we can actually create a query.

0:01:04.123,0:01:08.753
And in this instance, there's a SQL
box where we can paste that OS query

0:01:08.753,0:01:11.033
that we've copied from the GitHub page.

0:01:11.813,0:01:15.743
The second step that you want to do here
is actually select the devices you want

0:01:15.753,0:01:20.193
to execute this query against, and we can
do that under the Device selector option.

0:01:21.013,0:01:25.373
Now, this is a query that you should only
be running or only works against Windows

0:01:25.373,0:01:30.523
devices, so on the Filters option here,
we can expand Operating system and remove

0:01:30.523,0:01:35.413
macOS and Linux, and click Apply to
only focus on Windows operating systems.

0:01:35.863,0:01:39.693
Not that if you executed this against a
Linux device, it would cause any issues.

0:01:39.693,0:01:42.303
You would just be getting
errors for those devices.

0:01:43.093,0:01:46.773
Once you've selected a filter that's
appropriate for your organization,

0:01:47.023,0:01:50.613
you can then choose the devices that
you want to execute this against.

0:01:50.963,0:01:54.203
Now typically, I would actually
suggest running this across every

0:01:54.203,0:01:56.193
device within your organization.

0:01:56.273,0:01:59.193
Yes, there's even Windows endpoints
that we've come across that have had

0:01:59.483,0:02:01.733
RDP exposed incorrectly to the internet.

0:02:01.973,0:02:05.373
So definitely something that I would
recommend running this against as well.

0:02:05.983,0:02:08.603
So you can do that by selecting
this little tick box here.

0:02:09.243,0:02:12.643
Once you're happy with your selection,
you can click the Update Selected Devices

0:02:12.643,0:02:16.403
list to say those are the devices that we
actually want to execute this query on.

0:02:16.723,0:02:19.073
And as you can see here, we
have two endpoints selected.

0:02:20.003,0:02:23.713
Once you're happy with everything,
you can execute the query by selecting

0:02:23.713,0:02:25.143
Run Query on the bottom right.

0:02:25.153,0:02:28.193
It's going to prompt you and say,
do you want to run this untested

0:02:28.233,0:02:30.113
query, which of course we do.

0:02:30.943,0:02:33.703
And then what we'll do is we'll
wait for the results to come back.

0:02:34.363,0:02:37.653
Now, depending on the resources
of your machines, depending on

0:02:37.653,0:02:41.133
the network connections of those
machines will depend on how quickly

0:02:41.133,0:02:42.963
the results actually return.

0:02:43.353,0:02:46.093
It shouldn't take too long for
this query to actually execute,

0:02:46.333,0:02:47.363
but please do be patient.

0:02:47.363,0:02:50.453
As I say, it depends on a number of
factors on how quickly this query

0:02:50.453,0:02:52.133
will actually return results for you.

0:02:52.913,0:02:55.963
Once it's finished, you can look at
the status column and that will let

0:02:55.963,0:02:59.393
you know that this query has completed
or failed for whatever reason.

0:03:00.383,0:03:03.763
If you scroll up, there's a section
called Query results that will actually

0:03:03.763,0:03:05.773
show you the results of the query.

0:03:06.123,0:03:09.673
Now, hopefully in your environment, you
wouldn't actually get any results back

0:03:09.713,0:03:14.403
because that potentially means that
there's a RDP login or RDP logins from

0:03:14.403,0:03:18.283
external IP addresses and that could
indicate potential attacker activity.

0:03:18.968,0:03:22.678
Now, the most important field to take
note of after you've executed this

0:03:22.678,0:03:24.698
query would be the endpoint name.

0:03:24.898,0:03:28.128
So where are these RDP connections
actually taking place to?

0:03:28.128,0:03:31.688
So what device did that RDP
connection actually initiate on?

0:03:32.058,0:03:36.708
And as we can see, it's a
server 22 DC and server 2022.

0:03:36.718,0:03:39.338
We only have two devices
in our test environment.

0:03:39.338,0:03:43.218
So unfortunately, both of these
have been logged into with RDP

0:03:43.228,0:03:45.968
from external IP addresses.

0:03:46.638,0:03:50.098
What's also really useful is to know
the date and time that this occurred.

0:03:50.488,0:03:53.978
So expand that column out and you can
see exactly when this event took place.

0:03:54.408,0:03:58.268
The event ID is also incredibly useful
to understand what the event is.

0:03:58.278,0:04:01.458
And if you're not overly familiar with
those events, there's a description

0:04:01.458,0:04:04.338
column here that will give you a
very brief overview of what each

0:04:04.338,0:04:06.218
of those event IDs actually means.

0:04:06.928,0:04:10.178
Also, what's incredibly
beneficial is the username.

0:04:10.333,0:04:12.773
What was the account that
actually successfully logged in?

0:04:13.213,0:04:17.413
And subsequently, the source IP address
is an incredibly important field as well,

0:04:17.993,0:04:23.073
because that field is going to give you
the context of who or where the potential

0:04:23.073,0:04:24.983
attacker was actually logging in from.

0:04:25.603,0:04:29.633
Now, if you do see logins from
these non-RFC 1918 IP addresses,

0:04:29.683,0:04:32.673
I think it's definitely something
that warrants further investigation.

0:04:33.023,0:04:36.303
It may be a false positive, and it could
be an administrator that's, you know,

0:04:36.393,0:04:38.563
opened RDP on a server temporarily.

0:04:38.793,0:04:42.173
But again, if the administrator
can get in, so can attackers.

0:04:42.313,0:04:45.413
So at this point, you probably want
to take additional measures, such as

0:04:45.423,0:04:49.023
isolating that device and bringing in
an incident response team so they can

0:04:49.303,0:04:51.453
scope out the potential compromise.

0:04:52.563,0:04:54.003
I hope this video has been useful.

0:04:54.203,0:04:57.073
Thank you very much for your time
and I'll catch you on the next video.
