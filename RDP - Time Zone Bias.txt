Lee Kirkpatrick: Hi, my name is Lee
Kirkpatrick, and I'm an incident lead with

0:00:03.590,0:00:09.129
the Sophos Rapid Response team, and today
we're going to be talking about RDP bias.

0:00:09.879,0:00:13.180
Now, most of us, I'm sure, are quite
familiar with how to find and look

0:00:13.180,0:00:17.740
for suspicious RDP lateral movement,
whether that's looking based on

0:00:17.740,0:00:22.040
known compromised users, so maybe
you have an alert from antivirus or

0:00:22.079,0:00:26.050
EDR that's associated with a user and
you're currently pivoting from that.

0:00:26.384,0:00:30.525
Maybe you're looking at logins occurring
at strange times or logins with

0:00:30.555,0:00:35.585
unsuspecting users -- so why is James
connecting to a domain controller at 3 a.m.,

0:00:35.585,0:00:38.905
for example, when he typically
only accesses our Sage servers?

0:00:39.184,0:00:41.855
That would be a login
from an unexpected user.

0:00:41.855,0:00:44.115
Or why is someone logging in at 4 a.m.

0:00:44.244,0:00:47.864
when they typically only log in
between the hours of 9 and 5?

0:00:47.865,0:00:51.154
Looking for those typical things is
something I'm sure we're all familiar

0:00:51.154,0:00:56.566
with, but maybe something that's a little
less familiar is known as the RDP bias.

0:00:57.096,0:01:00.966
Now, this event is available in the
Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop

0:01:00.966,0:01:06.166
Services RDP Core TS Operational
Event Log, and it's Event ID 104.

0:01:07.876,0:01:11.676
Now, we've observed this event being
generated on Windows 10 and above,

0:01:11.956,0:01:14.306
and Windows Server 2016 and above.

0:01:14.541,0:01:18.241
So if you're performing an investigation
on a legacy operating system, it's

0:01:18.241,0:01:21.461
unlikely that you're actually going
to see these events, but with most

0:01:21.461,0:01:25.431
organizations shifting over to some
of these newer operating systems, it's

0:01:25.491,0:01:28.071
definitely something that you're still
going to want to keep an eye out for.

0:01:28.761,0:01:33.226
Now what this event shows you
is the time zone bias from

0:01:33.226,0:01:36.516
UTC of the connecting machine.

0:01:37.126,0:01:40.946
Now that's really important because
it can help you identify suspicious

0:01:40.966,0:01:45.456
RDP connections based on the
time zone of that RDP connection.

0:01:46.016,0:01:49.616
So let's say, as an example, your
users are typically based out of the

0:01:49.626,0:01:54.766
UK and their time zone bias from UTC at
present would be zero hours from UTC.

0:01:55.266,0:01:58.766
And typically when you see them
RDP into devices, you would have

0:01:58.806,0:02:00.666
a client time zone bias of zero.

0:02:01.396,0:02:06.166
Suddenly, you start seeing client time
zone biases of eight or six or various

0:02:06.166,0:02:10.836
other values that differ from the norm for
those users -- that could help you hone in

0:02:10.846,0:02:13.616
on potentially suspicious RDP connections.

0:02:13.996,0:02:19.026
Let's take an example where a user's
credentials have been phished, the

0:02:19.056,0:02:23.476
attacker's logged into the VPN -- because
you don't have NFA enabled -- and they

0:02:23.476,0:02:25.876
start accessing devices using RDP.

0:02:26.116,0:02:30.136
You would then start to see the
time zone of that attacker machine.

0:02:30.546,0:02:34.206
Now, typically attackers are going to
have their machines hosted somewhere in

0:02:34.206,0:02:38.356
the cloud on various different platforms
that are probably going to be in a

0:02:38.356,0:02:42.186
different time zone from that user or
where your users typically log in from.

0:02:42.476,0:02:46.066
So that can help you, again, hone in
on those suspicious RDP connections

0:02:46.076,0:02:48.216
with those strange time zone biases.

0:02:48.796,0:02:51.246
Now, of course, it's open to
false positives, depending on

0:02:51.246,0:02:54.526
how your organization functions
and all those sorts of things,

0:02:54.726,0:02:58.396
but it's definitely a beneficial
event log to keep an eye out for.

0:02:59.411,0:03:01.231
So how can we use Sophos
to search for these?

0:03:01.621,0:03:03.501
Well, it's actually incredibly simple.

0:03:03.691,0:03:06.691
There's a really neat feature in
Sophos called Live Discover that

0:03:06.701,0:03:08.671
allows us to execute OS query.

0:03:09.041,0:03:11.341
And then we can search for
that using the query that we've

0:03:11.341,0:03:13.631
actually put into the slides here.

0:03:14.441,0:03:17.711
So what we've done is we executed
that on one of our test systems just

0:03:17.711,0:03:19.151
to show you what that may look like.

0:03:19.291,0:03:24.171
And at the bottom is an output of that
query being executed and what you may see.

0:03:24.511,0:03:26.511
On the left, we have the endpoint name.

0:03:26.571,0:03:28.961
So where did this RDP connection occur on?

0:03:29.511,0:03:31.451
What date and time did that occur?

0:03:31.481,0:03:34.681
Which is really useful in looking at
some of the other RDP logs that we've

0:03:34.701,0:03:39.326
previously discussed, to find out the
user that logged in around this time

0:03:39.326,0:03:40.816
and would have generated this event.

0:03:41.336,0:03:46.736
The source is just where we found this
event ID, which is 104 in that column.

0:03:47.016,0:03:51.816
And then obviously the most important
column being the timezone bias hour.

0:03:52.196,0:03:55.966
So again, you can execute this query
across all devices within your environment

0:03:55.966,0:04:01.991
and start to look and identify if there
are time zone bias hours in the RDP core

0:04:01.991,0:04:06.231
TS operational event log that differ
from what you would typically expect.

0:04:07.231,0:04:08.481
Thank you very much for listening.

0:04:08.711,0:04:11.311
I hope this has taught you something
that maybe you didn't know about

0:04:11.351,0:04:14.911
RDP and hopefully helps you
identify suspicious RDP connections.

0:04:15.231,0:04:17.491
Thank you very much for your time
and catch you on the next video.
