Lee Kirkpatrick: Hi.

0:00:01.580,0:00:04.140
My name is Lee Kirkpatrick,
and I'm an incident lead with

0:00:04.140,0:00:05.740
the Sophos Rapid Response Team.

0:00:06.090,0:00:10.019
And in today's video, we're going to be
discussing some of the typical RDP queries

0:00:10.019,0:00:12.649
that we use during our investigations.

0:00:13.139,0:00:15.559
Now, I'm not going to go into
great depth about all of these

0:00:15.559,0:00:17.169
queries and exactly what they do.

0:00:17.439,0:00:21.049
In a later video, we'll actually be
showcasing these, how you can run

0:00:21.049,0:00:24.179
them in Sophos Central, and what
the output may look like for you.

0:00:24.770,0:00:27.490
But what we will be doing is just
running through some of the typical

0:00:27.490,0:00:31.494
queries that we utilize to get you
back up to speed with what you should

0:00:31.494,0:00:33.035
be looking for with regards to RDP.

0:00:34.075,0:00:39.055
Now, the first query that we typically run
is the 21-40 local session login events.

0:00:39.455,0:00:44.034
This actually queries for the typical
IDs that we're looking for in the

0:00:44.065,0:00:47.875
Terminal Services Local Session
Manager operational event log to show

0:00:47.904,0:00:52.045
connections, disconnects, reconnections,
all of those sorts of things.

0:00:52.510,0:00:57.390
We also subsequently used the 1149 RDP
logins query which looks in the Terminal

0:00:57.390,0:01:01.170
Services Remote Connection Manager
operational, specifically for the event

0:01:01.170,0:01:07.060
ID 1149 as the name suggests in order to
pull out those successful RDP connections.

0:01:07.685,0:01:11.365
Now you may think it's a little bit
redundant to query both of these event

0:01:11.375,0:01:13.435
logs, but there's a reason for that.

0:01:13.465,0:01:16.225
And that may be that the
attacker has cleared one of the

0:01:16.225,0:01:17.535
event logs, but not the other.

0:01:17.814,0:01:20.875
It may be that there was an error
in actually logging that event

0:01:20.875,0:01:23.785
for whatever reason, and one event
log has it and the other doesn't.

0:01:24.125,0:01:28.034
So always good to use as many sources
as possible when you're trying to look

0:01:28.044,0:01:30.175
for things like RDP lateral movement.

0:01:30.880,0:01:34.110
Another really useful query, and
we've discussed about the dangers

0:01:34.110,0:01:38.320
of exposing RDP to the internet in
previous videos, is a query called

0:01:38.390,0:01:40.780
RDP Logins from External IPs.

0:01:41.160,0:01:43.979
And the name is pretty obvious
as to what that query does.

0:01:43.980,0:01:48.009
It looks for RDP connections
from external IP addresses.

0:01:48.610,0:01:52.770
Now, this query actually looks in both of
the previous aforementioned event logs.

0:01:53.039,0:01:55.979
And as I say, something you should
definitely run throughout your

0:01:55.979,0:01:59.569
environment in order to identify if
there's potentially any RDP logins

0:01:59.570,0:02:02.009
occurring from external IP addresses.

0:02:03.390,0:02:07.810
Now, another query that I think quite
commonly gets overlooked with regards to

0:02:07.820,0:02:12.590
RDP is the 4624_4625 login events query.

0:02:12.990,0:02:18.020
Now, this is actually looking in the
security event log for 4624 event IDs,

0:02:18.059,0:02:23.329
which would be a successful logon, or
a 4625, which would be a failed logon.

0:02:24.040,0:02:26.900
Now, typically when we're looking for
these events, it's normally because

0:02:26.910,0:02:28.840
we're looking for network-based logons.

0:02:29.355,0:02:30.515
And that's absolutely fine.

0:02:30.515,0:02:31.205
You should be.

0:02:31.595,0:02:34.285
And that would be a logon of type three.

0:02:34.295,0:02:36.915
So with each of these events,
there's a logon type, and that kind

0:02:36.915,0:02:38.945
of indicates what that logon is.

0:02:38.955,0:02:42.614
So a logon type three would be a
network-based logon, and a logon type

0:02:42.655,0:02:45.515
10 would be an RDP logon, for example.

0:02:46.114,0:02:50.775
Now, the reason that we query for this,
when we're actually looking for possible

0:02:50.805,0:02:57.145
RDP lateral movement, is because it
can help us identify failed logins when

0:02:57.225,0:02:59.655
Network Level Authentication is enabled.

0:03:00.114,0:03:05.624
So with RDP, if you fail to logon and
Network Level Authentication or NLA

0:03:05.624,0:03:10.825
is enabled, you will see a 4625, so
a failed logon with a logon type 3.

0:03:11.395,0:03:14.225
Now that may be a little bit confusing
because you would think that's a

0:03:14.225,0:03:16.105
network-based logon, and it is.

0:03:16.435,0:03:19.895
But typically they're associated
with something like SMB, for example.

0:03:20.215,0:03:21.725
So why are we seeing that here?

0:03:21.875,0:03:26.225
And that's because of network-level
authentication being enabled with RDP.

0:03:26.544,0:03:31.394
It authenticates over the network
prior to establishing the RDP session.

0:03:32.004,0:03:36.715
So it's just as important to look for
those failed logon events as it is

0:03:36.745,0:03:38.695
those successful logon events as well.

0:03:39.430,0:03:43.530
Now, what you can also do with Sophos is
you don't just have to use it in order

0:03:43.530,0:03:48.239
to try and identify lateral movement
with RDP; you can also use it to identify

0:03:48.280,0:03:50.400
misconfigurations within your environment.

0:03:50.929,0:03:55.789
So, a lot of the times when we go into
environments for an investigation,

0:03:56.305,0:03:59.245
we look for things that are
misconfigured, and one of those being,

0:03:59.245,0:04:02.905
especially with RDP, network-level
authentication being disabled.

0:04:03.215,0:04:05.725
Now, the reason that's enabled
by default is because it adds

0:04:05.765,0:04:10.545
additional layers of security, so
disabling that is not a good idea.

0:04:10.895,0:04:14.784
And what we've done in this presentation
is create a really quick query that

0:04:15.194,0:04:20.315
queries the registry, and looks for a
specific key having a certain value that

0:04:20.315,0:04:23.215
would indicate that NLA has been disabled.

0:04:23.575,0:04:29.405
So not only can you use Sophos to
identify RDP lateral movement, you

0:04:29.405,0:04:33.985
can also use it to proactively find
misconfigurations within your environment

0:04:34.225,0:04:38.235
and make sure that you fix those prior
to an incident actually occurring.

0:04:39.455,0:04:40.724
Thank you very much for your time.

0:04:40.955,0:04:44.965
I hope this video has helped you better
understand what queries you can use in

0:04:44.985,0:04:49.335
order to better identify lateral movement
using RDP and hopefully giving you a

0:04:49.435,0:04:53.055
nice little tip on how you can better
identify possible misconfigurations.

0:04:53.224,0:04:55.534
Thank you very much for your time
and catch you on the next video.
